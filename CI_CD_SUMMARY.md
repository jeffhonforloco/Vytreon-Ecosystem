   - Continuous Deployment pipeline
   - Runs on: Push to main (+ manual trigger)
   - Builds production version
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

3. **`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`**
   - Security scanning with CodeQL
   - Runs on: Push to main, PRs, Weekly schedule
   - Analyzes code for vulnerabilities
   - Reports findings in Security tab

4. **`.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Changes
```bash
cd /Users/jeffhonforloco/Github/Vytreon-Ecosystem/Vytreon-Ecosystem
git status
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "ci: add complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

- Add CI workflow for linting and building
- Add CD workflow for GitHub Pages deployment
- Add CodeQL security scanning
- Add Lighthouse performance testing
- Add Dependabot for dependency updates
- Add PR and issue templates
- Update documentation and contributing guidelines
- Configure Vite for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/settings/pages`
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/settings/branches`
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Select: `build-and-test (Node.js 20.x)`
5. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
After pushing:

1. **Check Actions Tab**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/actions`
   - Verify CI workflow runs successfully
   - Verify Deploy workflow runs successfully

2. **Check Deployment**
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Visit: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Vytreon-Ecosystem/`
   - Your site should be live!

3. **Check Security Tab**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/security`
   - Verify CodeQL scanning is active

## 🔄 How It Works

### On Every Push/PR to main or develop:
1. **CI Workflow triggers**
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs ESLint
   - Builds the project
   - Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
   - ✅ Must pass before merge

### On Push to main:
1. **Deploy Workflow triggers**
   - Builds production version
   - Uploads to GitHub Pages
   - Site goes live automatically

2. **CodeQL Workflow triggers**
   - Scans for security vulnerabilities
   - Reports findings

### On PR to main:
1. **Lighthouse Workflow triggers**
   - Tests performance
   - Tests accessibility
   - Tests SEO
   - Tests best practices
   - Uploads detailed report

### Weekly (Mondays):
1. **Dependabot checks** for npm updates
2. **CodeQL scans** for security issues

### Monthly:
1. **Dependabot checks** for GitHub Actions updates

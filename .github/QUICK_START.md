# üöÄ Quick Start - CI/CD Setup Complete!

Your Vytreon Ecosystem repository is now configured with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## What's Been Set Up

### ‚úÖ Workflows Created

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Continuous Integration
   - Runs on every push and pull request
   - Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
   - Lints and builds the project
   - Uploads build artifacts

2. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Continuous Deployment
   - Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on main branch
   - Can be triggered manually via GitHub UI
   - Deploys production builds

3. **`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`** - Security Scanning
   - Runs on push to main and PRs
   - Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays)
   - Analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript for vulnerabilities

4. **`.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`** - Performance Testing
   - Runs Lighthouse CI on pull requests
   - Checks performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices
   - Uploads detailed reports

### ‚úÖ Configuration Files

- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** - Automated dependency updates
- **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** - Standardized PR format
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`** - Bug reports and feature requests
- **`.github/lighthouse/lighthouserc.json`** - Lighthouse configuration
- **`.gitignore`** - Updated with CI/CD artifacts

### ‚úÖ Documentation

- **`.github/CICD_SETUP.md`** - Complete CI/CD setup guide
- **`README.md`** - Updated with development workflow
- **`.github/QUICK_START.md`** - This file!

### ‚úÖ Code Updates

- **`vite.config.ts`** - Updated with GitHub Pages base path for production

## Next Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Required for Auto-Deployment)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save changes
```

### 2. Test the CI Pipeline

```bash
# Push your changes to trigger CI
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main

# Watch the workflow run at:
# https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/actions
```

### 3. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vytreon-Ecosystem/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: main
4. Enable:
   ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ‚úÖ Select: build-and-test (Node.js 20.x)
5. Save changes
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

After pushing to main:
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Vytreon-Ecosystem/`

## Testing Locally

Before pushing, test everything works:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linter (must pass for CI)
npm run lint

# Build for production (must succeed for CI)
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Workflow Triggers

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| CI | Push/PR to main/develop | Test and lint code |
| Deploy | Push to main | Deploy to GitHub Pages |
| CodeQL | Push to main, Weekly | Security scanning |
| Lighthouse | PR to main | Performance check |

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server

# Testing
npm run lint            # Run linter
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run preview         # Preview production build

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature/my-feature   # Create feature branch
git add .                             # Stage changes
git commit -m "feat: my feature"     # Commit (use conventional commits)
git push origin feature/my-feature   # Push to GitHub
```

## Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits for better automation:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: resolve navigation bug"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

## Monitoring Your Workflows

### View Workflow Runs
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. See all workflow runs and their status
3. Click any run for detailed logs

### Check Deployment Status
1. Actions tab ‚Üí Deploy to GitHub Pages workflow
2. Wait for green checkmark
3. Click the deployment URL to view your site

### Security Alerts
1. Go to the **Security** tab
2. Check CodeQL scanning results
3. Review and fix any vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Run locally to debug
npm run build

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# View detailed error in Actions tab
```

### Deployment Not Working
1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Check that deploy.yml workflow succeeded
3. Ensure vite.config.ts has correct base path

### Workflow Not Triggering
1. Check that you pushed to the correct branch
2. Verify workflow triggers in `.yml` file
3. Check Actions tab for disabled workflows
